NXP DPAA2 Eventdev Driver
=========================

The dpaa2 eventdev is an implementation of the eventdev API, that provides a
wide range of the eventdev features. The eventdev relies on a dpaa2 hw to
perform event scheduling.

More information can be found at `NXP Official Website
<http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/arm-processors/qoriq-arm-processors:QORIQ-ARM>`_.

Features
--------

The DPAA2 EVENTDEV implements many features in the eventdev API;

- Hardware based event scheduler
- 8 event ports
- 8 event queues
- Parallel flows
- Atomic flows

Supported DPAA2 SoCs
--------------------

- LS2080A/LS2040A
- LS2084A/LS2044A
- LS2088A/LS2048A
- LS1088A/LS1048A

Prerequisites
-------------

There are three main pre-requisities for executing DPAA2 EVENTDEV on a DPAA2
compatible board:

1. **ARM 64 Tool Chain**

   For example, the `*aarch64* Linaro Toolchain <https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2017.01/aarch64-linux-gnu>`_.

2. **Linux Kernel**

   It can be obtained from `NXP's Github hosting <https://github.com/qoriq-open-source/linux>`_.

3. **Rootfile system**

   Any *aarch64* supporting filesystem can be used. For example,
   Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) or 16.04 LTS (Xenial) userland which can be obtained
   from `here <http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/16.04/release/ubuntu-base-16.04.1-base-arm64.tar.gz>`_.

As an alternative method, DPAA2 EVENTDEV can also be executed using images provided
as part of SDK from NXP. The SDK includes all the above prerequisites necessary
to bring up a DPAA2 board.

The following dependencies are not part of DPDK and must be installed
separately:

- **NXP Linux SDK**

  NXP Linux software development kit (SDK) includes support for family
  of QorIQÂ® ARM-Architecture-based system on chip (SoC) processors
  and corresponding boards.

  It includes the Linux board support packages (BSPs) for NXP SoCs,
  a fully operational tool chain, kernel and board specific modules.

  SDK and related information can be obtained from:  `NXP QorIQ SDK  <http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/linux-sdk/linux-sdk-for-qoriq-processors:SDKLINUX>`_.

- **DPDK Extra Scripts**

  DPAA2 based resources can be configured easily with the help of ready scripts
  as provided in the DPDK Extra repository.

  `DPDK Extras Scripts <https://github.com/qoriq-open-source/dpdk-extras>`_.

Currently supported by DPDK:

- NXP SDK **2.0+**.
- MC Firmware version **10.0.0** and higher.
- Supported architectures:  **arm64 LE**.

- Follow the DPDK :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` to setup the basic DPDK environment.

.. note::

   Some part of fslmc bus code (mc flib - object library) routines are
   dual licensed (BSD & GPLv2).

Pre-Installation Configuration
------------------------------

Config File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options can be modified in the ``config`` file.
Please note that enabling debugging options may affect system performance.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_DPAA2_EVENTDEV`` (default ``y``)

  Toggle compilation of the ``lrte_pmd_dpaa2_event`` driver.

Driver Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile the DPAA2 EVENTDEV PMD for Linux arm64 gcc target, run the
following ``make`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   cd <DPDK-source-directory>
   make config T=arm64-dpaa2-linuxapp-gcc install

Initialization
--------------

The dpaa2 eventdev is exposed as a vdev device which consists of a set of dpcon
devices and dpci devices. On EAL initialization, dpcon and dpci devices will be
probed and then vdev device can be created from the application code by

* Invoking ``rte_vdev_init("event_dpaa2")`` from the application

* Using ``--vdev="event_dpaa2"`` in the EAL options, which will call
  rte_vdev_init() internally

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./your_eventdev_application --vdev="event_dpaa2"

Limitations
-----------

Platform Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DPAA2 drivers for DPDK can only work on NXP SoCs as listed in the
``Supported DPAA2 SoCs``.

Port-core binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DPAA2 EVENTDEV driver requires event port 'x' to be used on core 'x'.
