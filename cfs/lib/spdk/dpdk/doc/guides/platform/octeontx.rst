OCTEONTX Board Support Package
==============================

This doc has information about steps to setup octeontx platform
and information about common offload hw block drivers of
**Cavium OCTEONTX** SoC family.


More information about SoC can be found at `Cavium, Inc Official Website
<http://www.cavium.com/OCTEON-TX_ARM_Processors.html>`_.

Common Offload HW Block Drivers
-------------------------------

1. **Eventdev Driver**
   See :doc: `../eventdevs/octeontx.rst` for octeontx ssovf eventdev driver
   information.

2. **Mempool Driver**
   See :doc: `../mempool/octeontx.rst` for octeontx fpavf mempool driver
   information.

Steps To Setup Platform
-----------------------

There are three main pre-prerequisites for setting up Platform drivers on
OCTEONTX compatible board:

1. **OCTEONTX Linux kernel PF driver for Network acceleration HW blocks**

   The OCTEONTX Linux kernel drivers (includes the required PF driver for the
   Platform drivers) are available on Github at `octeontx-kmod <https://github.com/caviumnetworks/octeontx-kmod>`_
   along with build, install and dpdk usage instructions.

2. **ARM64 Tool Chain**

   For example, the *aarch64* Linaro Toolchain, which can be obtained from
   `here <https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2017.01/aarch64-linux-gnu>`_.

3. **Rootfile system**

   Any *aarch64* supporting filesystem can be used. For example,
   Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) or 16.04 LTS (Xenial) userland which can be obtained
   from `<http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/16.04/release/ubuntu-base-16.04.1-base-arm64.tar.gz>`_.

   As an alternative method, Platform drivers can also be executed using images provided
   as part of SDK from Cavium. The SDK includes all the above prerequisites necessary
   to bring up a OCTEONTX board.

   SDK and related information can be obtained from: `Cavium support site <https://support.cavium.com/>`_.

- Follow the DPDK :doc: `../linux_gsg/index.rst` to setup the basic DPDK environment.
