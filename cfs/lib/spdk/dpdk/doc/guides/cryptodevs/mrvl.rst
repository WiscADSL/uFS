MRVL Crypto Poll Mode Driver
============================

The MRVL CRYPTO PMD (**librte_crypto_mrvl_pmd**) provides poll mode crypto driver
support by utilizing MUSDK library, which provides cryptographic operations
acceleration by using Security Acceleration Engine (EIP197) directly from
user-space with minimum overhead and high performance.

Features
--------

MRVL CRYPTO PMD has support for:

* Symmetric crypto
* Sym operation chaining
* AES CBC (128)
* AES CBC (192)
* AES CBC (256)
* AES CTR (128)
* AES CTR (192)
* AES CTR (256)
* 3DES CBC
* 3DES CTR
* MD5
* MD5 HMAC
* SHA1
* SHA1 HMAC
* SHA256
* SHA256 HMAC
* SHA384
* SHA384 HMAC
* SHA512
* SHA512 HMAC
* AES GCM (128)

Limitations
-----------

* Hardware only supports scenarios where ICV (digest buffer) is placed just
  after the authenticated data. Other placement will result in error.

Installation
------------

MRVL CRYPTO PMD driver compilation is disabled by default due to external dependencies.
Currently there are two driver specific compilation options in
``config/common_base`` available:

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MRVL_CRYPTO`` (default ``n``)

    Toggle compilation of the librte_pmd_mrvl driver.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MRVL_CRYPTO_DEBUG`` (default ``n``)

    Toggle display of debugging messages.

For a list of prerequisites please refer to `Prerequisites` section in
:ref:`MRVL Poll Mode Driver <mrvl_poll_mode_driver>` guide.

MRVL CRYPTO PMD requires MUSDK built with EIP197 support thus following
extra option must be passed to the library configuration script:

.. code-block:: console

   --enable-sam

For `crypto_safexcel.ko` module build instructions please refer
to `doc/musdk_get_started.txt`.

Initialization
--------------

After successfully building MRVL CRYPTO PMD, the following modules need to be
loaded:

.. code-block:: console

   insmod musdk_uio.ko
   insmod mvpp2x_sysfs.ko
   insmod mv_pp_uio.ko
   insmod mv_sam_uio.ko
   insmod crypto_safexcel.ko

The following parameters (all optional) are exported by the driver:

* max_nb_queue_pairs: maximum number of queue pairs in the device (8 by default).
* max_nb_sessions: maximum number of sessions that can be created (2048 by default).
* socket_id: socket on which to allocate the device resources on.

l2fwd-crypto example application can be used to verify MRVL CRYPTO PMD
operation:

.. code-block:: console

   ./l2fwd-crypto --vdev=net_mrvl,iface=eth0 --vdev=crypto_mrvl -- \
     --cipher_op ENCRYPT --cipher_algo aes-cbc \
     --cipher_key 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f  \
     --auth_op GENERATE --auth_algo sha1-hmac \
     --auth_key 10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18:19:1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f

Example output:

.. code-block:: console
