 * virtual function that is a child of the PF. This command allows to reserve
 * resources for a VF by its parent PF. To reverse the process, the command
 * should be called with all enables flags cleared for resources. This will free
 * allocated resources for the VF and return them to the resource pool. If this
 * command is requested by a VF driver to configure or reserve resources, then
 * the HWRM shall fail this command. If default MAC address and/or VLAN are
 * provided in this command, then the HWRM shall set up appropriate MAC/VLAN
 * filters for the function that is being configured. If source properties
 * checks are enabled and default MAC address and/or IP address are provided in
 * this command, then the HWRM shall set appropriate source property checks
 * based on provided MAC and/or IP addresses. The parent PF driver should not
 * set MTU/MRU for a VF using this command. This is to allow MTU/MRU setting by
 * the VF driver. If the MTU or MRU for a VF is set by the PF driver, then the
 * HWRM should ignore it. A function's MTU/MRU should be set prior to allocating
 * RX VNICs or TX rings. A PF driver calls hwrm_func_cfg to allocate resources
 * for itself or its children VFs. All function drivers shall call hwrm_func_cfg
 * to reserve resources. A request to hwrm_func_cfg may not be fully granted;
 * that is, a request for resources may be larger than what can be supported by
 * the device and the HWRM will allocate the best set of resources available,
 * but that may be less than requested. If all the amounts requested could not
 * be fulfilled, the HWRM shall allocate what it could and return a status code
 * of success. A function driver should call hwrm_func_qcfg immediately after
 * hwrm_func_cfg to determine what resources were assigned to the configured
 * function. A call by a PF driver to hwrm_func_cfg to allocate resources for
 * itself shall only allocate resources for the PF driver to use, not for its
 * children VFs. Likewise, a call to hwrm_func_qcfg shall return the resources
 * available for the PF driver to use, not what is available to its children
 * VFs.

/*
 * Description: An L2 filter is a filter resource that is used to identify a
 * vnic or ring for a packet based on layer 2 fields. Layer 2 fields for
 * encapsulated packets include both outer L2 header and/or inner l2 header of
 * encapsulated packet. The L2 filter resource covers the following OS specific
 * L2 filters. Linux/FreeBSD (per function): # Broadcast enable/disable # List
 * of individual multicast filters # All multicast enable/disable filter #
 * Unicast filters # Promiscuous mode VMware: # Broadcast enable/disable (per
 * physical function) # All multicast enable/disable	(per function) # Unicast
 * filters per ring or vnic # Promiscuous mode per PF Windows: # Broadcast
 * enable/disable (per physical function) # List of individual multicast filters
 * (Driver needs to advertise the maximum number of filters supported) # All
 * multicast enable/disable per physical function # Unicast filters per vnic #
 * Promiscuous mode per PF Implementation notes on the use of VNIC in this
 * command: # By default, these filters belong to default vnic for the function.
 * # Once these filters are set up, only destination VNIC can be modified. # If
 * the destination VNIC is not specified in this command, then the HWRM shall
 * only create an l2 context id. HWRM Implementation notes for multicast
 * filters: # The hwrm_filter_alloc command can be used to set up multicast
 * filters (perfect match or partial match). Each individual function driver can
 * set up multicast filters independently. # The HWRM needs to keep track of
 * multicast filters set up by function drivers and maintain multicast group
 * replication records to enable a subset of functions to receive traffic for a
 * specific multicast address. # When a specific multicast filter cannot be set,
 * the HWRM shall return an error. In this error case, the driver should fall
 * back to using one general filter	(rather than specific) for all multicast
 * traffic. # When the SR-IOV is enabled, the HWRM needs to additionally track
 * source knockout per multicast group record. Examples of setting unicast
 * filters: For a unicast MAC based filter, one can use a combination of the
 * fields and masks provided in this command to set up the filter. Below are
 * some examples: # MAC + no VLAN filter: This filter is used to identify
 * traffic that does not contain any VLAN tags and matches destination	(or
 * source) MAC address. This filter can be set up by setting only l2_addr field
 * to be a valid field. All other fields are not valid. The following value is
 * set for l2_addr. l2_addr = MAC # MAC + Any VLAN filter: This filter is used
 * to identify traffic that carries single VLAN tag and matches	(destination or
 * source) MAC address. This filter can be set up by setting only l2_addr and
 * l2_ovlan_mask fields to be valid fields. All other fields are not valid. The
 * following values are set for those two valid fields. l2_addr = MAC,
 * l2_ovlan_mask = 0xFFFF # MAC + no VLAN or VLAN ID=0: This filter is used to
 * identify untagged traffic that does not contain any VLAN tags or a VLAN tag
 * with VLAN ID = 0 and matches destination (or source) MAC address. This filter
 * can be set up by setting only l2_addr and l2_ovlan fields to be valid fields.
 * All other fields are not valid. The following value are set for l2_addr and
 * l2_ovlan. l2_addr = MAC, l2_ovlan = 0x0 # MAC + no VLAN or any VLAN: This
 * filter is used to identify traffic that contains zero or 1 VLAN tag and
 * matches destination	(or source) MAC address. This filter can be set up by
 * setting only l2_addr, l2_ovlan, and l2_mask fields to be valid fields. All
 * other fields are not valid. The following value are set for l2_addr,
 * l2_ovlan, and l2_mask fields. l2_addr = MAC, l2_ovlan = 0x0, l2_ovlan_mask =
 * 0xFFFF # MAC + VLAN ID filter: This filter can be set up by setting only
 * l2_addr, l2_ovlan, and l2_ovlan_mask fields to be valid fields. All other
 * fields are not valid. The following values are set for those three valid
 * fields. l2_addr = MAC, l2_ovlan = VLAN ID, l2_ovlan_mask = 0xF000
