uFS is a filesystem semi-microkernel that designs for device performance delivery and scalability.
We primarily design for modern ultra-fast NVMe devices and multi-core machine. uFS runs as a standalone user-level filesystem process, provides POSIX compatible APIs and crash consistency guarantee, and dynamically adapts to the application demands.

You could learn more about uFS design and semi-microkernel approach in our SOSP'21 paper *[Scale and Performance in a Filesystem Semi-microkernel](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/ufs-sosp21.pdf)*.


## Repo Structure

```

 |---- cfs
         |---- include               # uFS's cpp headers
         |---- lib                   # uFS's dependent libraries
         |---- src                   # uFS's cpp source code
         |---- test                  # tests for uFS, including utility tools like cli and mkfs
         |---- tools
 |---- cfs_bench
         |---- bench                 # cpp source code for uFS's microbench
         |---- exprs                 # scripts to run uFS's experiments
         |---- helpers

```

The other benchmarks in our paper besides microbenchmark (`cfs_bench`) are in a separate repo [uFS-bench](https://github.com/WiscADSL/uFS-bench), including `filebench`, `leveldb` and `scalefs_bench`.

## Get Started

We have tested uFS on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (both with Linux 5.4). We use `c++20`, `gcc-10`, and `g++-10`. uFS relies on
the user-level NVMe driver provided by SPDK and the version (18.04) is embeded in this repo.

### Download and Build

Please check this [section](https://github.com/WiscADSL/uFS/tree/main/cfs_bench/exprs/artifact_eval#initialization) in artifact evalution document to *setup the environments* and *install necessary dependencies*.
Then to build uFS, try these:

```
# assume all the dependencies have been installed by artifact_eval.sh
cd cfs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(proc)              # proc: set it according to core number
```

### A Simple Example

After building uFS, please reboot the machine and we recommand always run `ae init-after-reboot` immediately after booting to setup the pinned memory required by SPDK. This [document](./cfs/test/client/CLI-README.md) illustrates the very basic example to domenstrate uFS is successfully running with our command line tool (CLI).

## Artifact and Experiments of the Paper

We provide full automation for building, running and visualizing our experiments in the SOSP paper [here](https://github.com/WiscADSL/uFS/tree/sosp-21/cfs_bench/exprs/artifact_eval); please check tag [`sosp-21`](https://github.com/WiscADSL/uFS/tree/sosp-21) and tag [`sosp-21-filebench-config`](https://github.com/WiscADSL/uFS/tree/sosp-21-filebench-config) for details.

We thank the anonymous artifact evaluators for giving us feedback.

## Fun Facts

1. You may notice the source code directory is named as `cfs`. Who is cfs? Well, uFS has experienced several iterations, and the version you see is the third one. R.I.P. for our dear version a and b.

2. Actually, version a and version b were not named as afs and bfs. They were called vsfs (very simple filesystem, later also commented by someone as "very stupid filesystem") and uffs (user-level fast filesystem). When the third iteration started, the poor author ran out of the idea of naming, so she decided to name future versions as cfs, dfs, efs, etc., and wished we won't have a ufs version of uFS. Fortunately, cfs survived.
